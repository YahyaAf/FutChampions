# FUT Champions Project

## Description

The **FUT Champions** project is a web application that allows users to manage and evaluate football players, with a special focus on player ratings and statistics. Users can add players, view their details, and evaluate them based on various performance metrics. The project is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, utilizing HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.

## Features

- **Player Registration**: Users can add players with details such as name, photo, position, nationality, club, and more.
- **Dynamic Rating System**: Players' ratings are evaluated based on their position. Goalkeepers (GK) have different rating criteria compared to field players (players).
- **Validation System**: Ensures all required fields are properly filled before submission, providing feedback to users on incomplete forms.
- **Responsive Design**: The project uses Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and clean user interface.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and logic for managing players and their ratings.
